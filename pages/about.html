              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                
Debate is often an activity that is tried once or twice, barely grasped, and then resigned to be too difficult. Often, attempts by large organizations to cram information into new debaters leave them confused and overwhelmed without the tools to form a solid foundation for future growth. After 5 years of debating internationally, I have condensed the knowledge of countless more accomplished mentors into easy-to-understand courses to propel new debaters of all backgrounds into intermediate and advanced debaters. DebateCraft is a student run nonprofit initiative designed to empower middle
                and high school students. Our focus is on equipping them with
                essential skills in argumentation, advocacy, and public
                speaking. We aim to provide high-quality debate education to
                under-resourced and underrepresented students, empowering them
                to excel academically and in life.

                <h3>Empowering students</h3>
                <p>
                  Our mission centers on students empowering students by providing them
                  with the tools of debate. Through our programs, we nurture
                  confidence, self-expression, and critical thinking, allowing
                  students to articulate their thoughts and ideas effectively in
                  academic settings and beyond.

                <h3>Increasing Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                  We strive to make debate education accessible to all,
                  especially for students from underrepresented backgrounds. By
                  breaking down barriers, we create opportunities for these
                  students to develop skills that enhance their public speaking
                  and argumentation abilities, leading to increased success in
                  their academic and future professional lives.

                <h3>Beyond debate rounds</h3>
                <p>
                  Debate skills extend beyond the classroom. By mastering
                  argumentation and public speaking, students enhance their
                  academic performance and become more confident individuals.
                  They learn to engage in constructive discussions, solve
                  problems creatively, and advocate for themselves and their
                  peers, preparing them for success in all areas of life.
